Greetings everyone!

I had no idea anyone was still using this.
It was a little project to learn to write Chrome extensions and experiment with over-the-top refactoring.

Appologies to anyone who uses it but wanted more.
I will probably poke around with it and put it back up on Chrome as it appears to be gone.

More to come? Maybe?
